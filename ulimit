https://www.osc.edu/resources/getting_started/howto/howto_use_ulimit_command_to_set_soft_limits


This document shows you how to set soft limits using ulimit command.

- The ulimit command sets or reports user process resource limits. 
- The default limits are defined and applied when a new user is added to the system. 
- Limits are categorized as either soft or hard. 
- With the ulimit command, you can change your soft limits for the current shell environment, up to the maximum set by the hard
limits. 
- You must have root user authority to change resource hard limits.


-a Lists all of the current resource limits

-c Specifies the size of core dumps, in number of 512-byte blocks
 
-d Specifies the size of the data area, in number of K bytes

-f Sets the file size limit in blocks when the Limit parameter is used, or reports the file size limit if no parameter is specified. The -f flag is the default

-H Specifies that the hard limit for the given resource is set. If you have root user authority, you can increase the hard limit. Anyone can decrease it

-m Specifies the size of physical memory, in number of K bytes

-n Specifies the limit on the number of file descriptors a process may have

-s Specifies the stack size, in number of K bytes

-S Specifies that the soft limit for the given resource is set. 
A soft limit can be increased up to the value of the hard limit. 
If neither the -H nor -S flags are specified, the limit applies to both

-t Specifies the number of seconds to be used by each process


The limit for a specified resource is set when the Limit parameter is specified. The value of the Limit parameter can be 
a number in the unit specified with each resource, or the value "unlimited". 

For example, to set the file size limit to 51,200 bytes, use:

ulimit -f 100


To set the size of core dumps to unlimited, use:

ulimit â€“c unlimited
